    <p>
      As a child, I remember very vividly being curious and explorative towards anything new. That was my main attitude.
      I was a dreamer, a deep thinker — a kid who wanted to try anything, supported and validated by my caregivers and
      protectors. I was keen on doing things myself but very eager to learn from others how to do those things so that I
      could perform any task or activity on my own. As most of us grow up, we are unconsciously and unintentionally conditioned by the emotional projections of the
      people who raise and protect us. As kids, we are prone to protection and therefore, in most cases, unintentionally
      held from living our true nature: playful, adventurous, explorative truth seekers. As was I, imposed by fear,
      doubt, and anxiety towards the unknown and, most of all, fear of failure. I unconsciously taught myself that only those who have natural talents for creative expression were able to make
      effortless art, paintings, designs, drawings, and more. I thought there were creatives and math kids. The words
      and other forms of expression you see in any of my concepts are all intentional, flowing from my being in its
      truest and deepest form. I believe that sharing my craft with the world is my Dharma — Sanskrit for life purpose.
